# Conditional-formatting-in-Excel
To practice my skills on conditional formatting and using sparklines on MicrosoftExcel

# Introduction
After my data visualization using Excel course on courseera, I decided to practice some of what I have learnt so far.
On week 1, I learnt conditional formatting (both trend and value-based formatting), sparklines, Macros and custom number formating.
I undertook this project on courseera to hone my skills.
The dataset used is a sales data consisting of sales made by different salespersons in different regions,their profit made and target profit across 4 quarters in 2021.

# Objectives
1. To demonstrate my understanding of the topic
2. To sharpen my critical thinking skills
3. To see the performance of different salespersons across the quarters of 2021
4. To view the sales performance across the regions

# Data Sourcing and Transformation
The data was made available by courseera for the project. No data Transformation was needed because the data was clean and had no missing values.

# Data Analysis and Visualization
The main aim of the project was to put into practice conditional formatting options and use of sparklines in data visualization.
1. I first applied value-based conditional formatting to indicate the quarters in which each salesperson failed to meet the sales target by highlighting their values in red.
2. Thereafter I applied color scales formatting to highlight the percentage progress made by the salesperson in achieving the sales target.
3. Finally, I used sparklines to show the trend of sales made by each salesperson through the quarters of the year.

# Findings and Recommendations
The highest sales was recorded from the West; with an average percentage progress of 105%.
All salespersons from the West had an increasing performance through the quarters of the year, as indicated by the sparklines. 

The North recorded the next highest sales; with an average percentage progress of 88%.
While some salespersons had an increasing performance through the quarters of the year, others had a decline in performance.

Then the South had an average Percentage progress of 83%, slightly lower than that of the north.

Finally, the East had the least sales through the quarters of the year, with an average percentage progress of 71%.

I will recommend that the salespersons with percentage progress over 100% should be granted incentives, as the increase in sales came majorly through their efforts.
I will also recommend that a root-cause analysis be performed for the East region to find out the reason for the low performance.
